# UNWSP-Python-Week-8
Program #1: Initials
Write a program that gets a string containing a person's first, middle, and last names, and displays their first, middle, and last initials.  For example, if the user enters John William Smith, the program should display J. W. S.

Program #2: Word Separator
Write a program that accepts as input a sentence in which all of the words are run together, but the first character of each word is uppercase.  Convert the sentence to a string in which the words are separated by spaces, and the first word starts with an uppercase.  For example the string "StopAndSmellTheRoses" would be converted to "Stop and smell the roses."

Program #3: Capital Quiz
Write a program that creates a dictionary containing the U.S. states as keys, and their capitals as values.  The program should then randomly quiz the user by displaying the name of a state and asking the user to enter the state's capital.  The program should count of the number of correct and incorrect responses.  (You could alternatively use another country and provinces, or countries of the world and capitals).

Pseudocode #4: Course Info
Write pseudocode for the following program.

Program #5: Course Info
Write a program that has the user input a bunch of course ID, course name pairs.  For example a course ID could be "COS 2005" and the course name could be "Python Programming."   Then ask the user for a subject (like "COS"). Finally,  the program will display the ID and name of all the courses having that subject.
