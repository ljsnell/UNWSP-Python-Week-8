# Program #5: Course Info
# Write a program that has the user input a bunch of course ID and course name pairs.  
# For example a course ID could be "COS 2005" and the course name could be "Python Programming."   
# Then ask the user for a subject (like "COS"). 
# Finally, the program will display the ID and name of all the courses having that subject.
