# Program #3: Capital Quiz
# Write a program that creates a dictionary containing the U.S. states as keys, 
# and their capitals as values.  
# The program should then randomly quiz the user by displaying the name of a state 
# and asking the user to enter the state's capital.  
# The program should count of the number of correct and incorrect responses.  
# (You could alternatively use another country and provinces, 
# or countries of the world and capitals).
